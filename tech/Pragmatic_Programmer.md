#book The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas
8/10 - must read, a bit outdated though

key programmer traits:
Individuality: Developers are unique, with their own strengths, weaknesses, preferences, and
dislikes. They create a personal environment reflecting their individuality.
Early Adopter/Fast Adapter: Pragmatic Programmers quickly grasp and integrate new technologies and
techniques, deriving confidence from experience.
Inquisitive: They ask questions, seeking to understand how things work and collecting facts that may
influence future decisions.
Critical Thinker: Pragmatic Programmers don't accept things at face value. They are skeptical and
view challenges in statements like "that's the way it's done" or promises of universal solutions.
Realistic: They understand the underlying nature of problems, enabling them to gauge difficulty and
estimate time realistically, providing the stamina to persevere.
Jack of All Trades: While specializing in their current job, they aim to be familiar with a broad
range of technologies, staying updated on developments for adaptability to new challenges.

Tip: Don’t Live with Broken Windows
Tip: Be a Catalyst for Change
Tip: Remember the Big Picture
Tip: Make Quality a Requirements Issue

Learn at least one new language every year.

Orthogonality - Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things

Tip: There Are No Final Decisions
Tip: Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target

Prototypes are for testing whether a solution IS POSSIBLE, Tracer Bullets are for testing how
accurate your current solution is to the ideal solution you want to create

Tip:  Prototype to Learn
Tip: Estimate to Avoid Surprises
Tip: Use the Power of Command Shells

Use Rubber Ducking

Consider DbC(Design by Contract)

Tip: Dead Programs Tell No Lies (Crash Early)
Tip: Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems
Tip: Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata
Tip: Use Blackboards to Coordinate Workflow
Tip: Don’t Program by Coincidence
Tip: Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms

When Should You Refactor?
1)Duplication
2)Nonorthogonal design
3)Outdated knowledge
4)Performance

Tip: Refactor Early, Refactor Often
TIp: Organize Around Functionality, Not Job Functions
Tip: Don’t Use Manual Procedures (at least try not to)
Tip: Test Early. Test Often. Test Automatically.
Tip: Sign Your Work
