Cracking the Coding Interview

#### The interview process

* Focus on Problem-Solving: These interviews assess your ability to tackle new algorithmic problems.
* Limited Time: Expect to delve into one or two questions within a 45-minute timeframe.
* Communication is Crucial: Think out loud and explain your thought process throughout the interview. Interviewers might
  offer hints, which is normal.
* Subjective Evaluation: A numeric score isn't assigned. Instead, interviewers assess your analytical skills, coding
  abilities, technical knowledge, experience, and cultural fit.
* False Negatives are Acceptable: Companies acknowledge that some good candidates might be rejected, but prioritize
  avoiding false positives (hiring unsuitable candidates).
* Problem-Solving Skills Matter: The ability to solve challenging problems with some guidance indicates strong potential
  and intelligence - valuable assets for companies.
* Data Structures & Algorithms: Understanding these fundamentals is beneficial as many interview problems involve them.
  It demonstrates a solid technical foundation.
* Whiteboard Coding: While not reflecting real-world coding scenarios, whiteboards help focus on the core problem
  without getting bogged down in syntax or boilerplate code. It also encourages communication.
* Not a Universal Approach: This interview style may not be suitable for all companies or roles. Some might prioritize
  experience or specific technology expertise.
* Imperfect but Functional: This process has limitations, but it's a common approach. The goal is to optimize your
  performance within this framework.

#### Behind the scenes

# General Process:

* Phone Screening: Often the first step, involving basic technical questions and assessing your fit for the company.
* On-Site Interviews: Typically consist of 3-6 interviews with engineers, hiring managers, and potentially teammates.
  These interviews cover various areas like coding, algorithms, system design, behavioral questions, and experience.
* Interview Feedback: After the interviews, your interviewers will provide written feedback that is used to make a
  hiring decision.

# Company Specifics:

* Microsoft: Values passionate individuals with strong technical skills. Interviewers may share feedback within the
  team. You might meet the hiring manager if you perform well.
* Amazon: Emphasizes scalability. "Bar Raiser" interviews exist to maintain a high hiring standard. Interviewers don't
  see each other's feedback until submitted.
* Google: Strong focus on analytical abilities and problem-solving skills. Interviewers don't make the final hiring
  decision; a committee reviews feedback and makes a recommendation.
* Apple: Looks for both technical skills and passion for the company and its products. Interviewers typically don't
  share feedback with each other. Final decisions involve directors and VPs.
* Facebook: Uses a role-based interview system with "Jedi" (behavioral), "Ninja" (algorithms/coding), and "Pirate" (
  system design) interviewers. Interviewers submit individual feedback before discussing your performance.
* Palantir: Interviews for specific teams. Phone interviews and coding assessments are common. On-site interviews cover
  experience, domain knowledge, and design. Interviewers discuss feedback with the hiring manager after your visit.

# Tips:

* Be prepared to discuss your passion for the company and the specific role.
* Practice coding on whiteboards and discussing your thought process.
* Tailor your answers to the specific company and role you are interviewing for.
* Follow up with your recruiter if you haven't heard back within a week.
