Cracking the Coding Interview

#### The interview process

* Focus on Problem-Solving: These interviews assess your ability to tackle new algorithmic problems.
* Limited Time: Expect to delve into one or two questions within a 45-minute timeframe.
* Communication is Crucial: Think out loud and explain your thought process throughout the interview. Interviewers might
  offer hints, which is normal.
* Subjective Evaluation: A numeric score isn't assigned. Instead, interviewers assess your analytical skills, coding
  abilities, technical knowledge, experience, and cultural fit.
* False Negatives are Acceptable: Companies acknowledge that some good candidates might be rejected, but prioritize
  avoiding false positives (hiring unsuitable candidates).
* Problem-Solving Skills Matter: The ability to solve challenging problems with some guidance indicates strong potential
  and intelligence - valuable assets for companies.
* Data Structures & Algorithms: Understanding these fundamentals is beneficial as many interview problems involve them.
  It demonstrates a solid technical foundation.
* Whiteboard Coding: While not reflecting real-world coding scenarios, whiteboards help focus on the core problem
  without getting bogged down in syntax or boilerplate code. It also encourages communication.
* Not a Universal Approach: This interview style may not be suitable for all companies or roles. Some might prioritize
  experience or specific technology expertise.
* Imperfect but Functional: This process has limitations, but it's a common approach. The goal is to optimize your
  performance within this framework.

#### Behind the scenes

# General Process:

* Phone Screening: Often the first step, involving basic technical questions and assessing your fit for the company.
* On-Site Interviews: Typically consist of 3-6 interviews with engineers, hiring managers, and potentially teammates.
  These interviews cover various areas like coding, algorithms, system design, behavioral questions, and experience.
* Interview Feedback: After the interviews, your interviewers will provide written feedback that is used to make a
  hiring decision.

# Company Specifics:

* Microsoft: Values passionate individuals with strong technical skills. Interviewers may share feedback within the
  team. You might meet the hiring manager if you perform well.
* Amazon: Emphasizes scalability. "Bar Raiser" interviews exist to maintain a high hiring standard. Interviewers don't
  see each other's feedback until submitted.
* Google: Strong focus on analytical abilities and problem-solving skills. Interviewers don't make the final hiring
  decision; a committee reviews feedback and makes a recommendation.
* Apple: Looks for both technical skills and passion for the company and its products. Interviewers typically don't
  share feedback with each other. Final decisions involve directors and VPs.
* Facebook: Uses a role-based interview system with "Jedi" (behavioral), "Ninja" (algorithms/coding), and "Pirate" (
  system design) interviewers. Interviewers submit individual feedback before discussing your performance.
* Palantir: Interviews for specific teams. Phone interviews and coding assessments are common. On-site interviews cover
  experience, domain knowledge, and design. Interviewers discuss feedback with the hiring manager after your visit.

# Tips:

* Be prepared to discuss your passion for the company and the specific role.
* Practice coding on whiteboards and discussing your thought process.
* Tailor your answers to the specific company and role you are interviewing for.
* Follow up with your recruiter if you haven't heard back within a week.

#### Special situations

* Experienced Candidates: They might be asked similar questions to recent grads, but interviewers might expect them to
  have a deeper understanding of the concepts being tested. Their performance on system design and architecture
  questions will be evaluated with respect to their experience level.
* Testers and SDETs: They should prepare for core testing problems and practice coding questions like regular
  developers. Additionally, they should practice testing the coding problems they solve and demonstrate strong
  communication skills.
* Product (and Program) Managers: Interviewers will assess their skills in handling ambiguity, customer focus (both
  attitude and technical skills), multi-level communication, passion for technology, and teamwork/leadership.
* Dev Lead and Managers: Strong coding skills are required and they will be assessed on teamwork/leadership,
  prioritization, communication, and "getting things done".
* Startups: The application and interview process can be variable. It's important to network and highlight your ability
  to hit the ground running with the specific technologies the startup uses. Interviewers will assess personality fit,
  skill set, and experience.
* Acquisitions and Acquihires: During the technical due diligence process, the acquirer will interview most or all of
  the startup's employees. These interviews are important and can determine which employees receive offers to join the
  acquirer and can affect the acquisition price.
* For Interviewers: The book advises against asking the exact questions in the book and to focus on medium and hard
  problems with multiple hurdles. Interviewers should avoid "scary" questions and offer positive reinforcement to
  candidates. They should also probe deeper on behavioral questions to understand the candidate's role in past
  situations.
