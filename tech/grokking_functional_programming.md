# Chapter 2, Pure Functions

## Definition

- Return a single value
- Result depends only on arguments
- Do not mutate existing values

## Why Pure Functions?

- **State problems**: Imperative/stateful code caused bugs
- **Solution 1 ‚Äì Copies**: Return/pass copies to avoid side effects
- **Solution 2 ‚Äì Recalculate**: Don‚Äôt store derived values (e.g., discount), recalc when needed
- **Solution 3 ‚Äì Pass state directly**: Remove boilerplate, pass data into functions

## Testing Benefits

- Easy to test
- Tests double as documentation if concise and clear

# Chapter 3, Immutable Values

## Mutability is Dangerous

- Imperative solution failed due to operations on Java‚Äôs `List` mutating arguments.
- Function signatures alone don‚Äôt reveal risks; implementations must be checked.

## Fighting Mutability with Copies

- Copy the input list and work only on the copy ‚Üí avoids surprising side effects.

## Shared Mutable State

- Defined as a variable shared across entities that can be mutated by them.
- Source of unpredictable bugs.

## Immutable Values as a Solution

- Functions that take/return only immutable values prevent unexpected mutations.

## Examples in Practice

- **Java String**: methods return new values (immutable approach).
- **Scala**: built-in immutable collections (`slice`, `append`, `appendAll`).

## Key Idea

- Functional programming = pure functions + immutable values.

# Chapter 4, Functions as values

## Higher-order functions (HOFs)

- Take other functions as parameters and/or return functions.
- Examples: `sortBy`, `map`, `filter`, `foldLeft`.

## Passing functions

- Java uses `Comparator` objects; Scala/FP pass functions directly (`=>` syntax).
- Lists remain **immutable** in Scala, improving robustness.

## Returning functions (Currying)

- Functions can return functions, allowing configuration.
- **Currying**: multiple parameter lists improve readability and type safety.

## foldLeft

- Reduces a list to a single value (e.g., sum).
- Both higher-order and curried (two parameter lists).

## Product types & immutability

- Combine multiple values safely.
- In Scala: `case class`.
- Work naturally with higher-order functions due to immutability.

# Chapter 5, Sequential programs

## 1. Deal with Lists of Lists using `flatten`

- Problem: handling `List[List[String]]` (e.g., books with multiple authors).
- Solution: use `flatten` to merge inner lists into one `List[String]`.

## 2. Write Sequential Programs using `flatMap`

- `flatMap` = `map` + `flatten`.
- Enables functional, pipeline-based sequential programs.
- Replaces traditional `for` loops.

## 3. Improve Readability with **for Comprehensions**

- `for` comprehensions are syntactic sugar for nested `flatMap`/`map` calls.
- Make sequential functional code cleaner and easier to read.

## 4. Use Conditions Inside **for Comprehensions**

- Three filtering methods:
    1. Using `filter` function.
    2. Using **guard expressions** (`if` inside `for`).
    3. Using a filtering function with `flatMap`.
- `filter` and guards work on collections; `flatMap`-based filtering is generic.

## 5. Explore More Types with `flatMap`

- Other types supporting `flatMap`: `Set`, `Option`.
- You can combine multiple types in one `for` comprehension.
- Example use case: build parsers or sequential pipelines using `Option`.

üëâ **Core idea:**  
`flatten`, `flatMap`, and `for` comprehensions allow writing readable, functional, sequential programs that work
consistently across multiple types like `List`, `Set`, and `Option`.

# Chapter 6, Error handling

## 1. Handle Errors Without Nulls or Exceptions

- In functional programming, **errors are values**, not control flow mechanisms.
- Instead of `null` or exceptions, use immutable containers like `Option` or `Either`.

## 2. Handle All Corner Cases

- **Checked exceptions** are not composable.
- `Option` and `Either` simplify error handling with **`orElse`**, which combines two immutable results and picks one.
- This approach scales cleanly across complex code.

## 3. Indicate Errors in Function Signatures

- Pure functions explicitly expose potential failure in their **type signatures**:
    - `Option` ‚Üí result may be missing.
    - `Either` ‚Üí result may contain an error value.
- The type system forces handling of all possible error cases.

## 4. Compose Bigger Functionalities from Smaller Ones

- Split requirements into small, pure functions, each returning an error-aware value.
- Combine them using **composition** and **`foldLeft`** for ‚Äúall-or-nothing‚Äù error handling.
- The compiler enforces correct handling of all branches.

## 5. Return User-Friendly and Descriptive Errors

- `Either` allows attaching **descriptive messages** (`Left[String]`) instead of generic failures.
- Makes debugging and user feedback clearer.

### Step-by-Step Recap

1. **Higher-order functions** ‚Äì used for clean error handling (from Chapter 4).
2. **Option** ‚Äì signal possible absence of value (from Chapter 5).
3. **Functional vs Checked Exceptions** ‚Äì FP is more composable, readable, and concise.
4. **Handle Many Errors** ‚Äì use higher-order functions that scale single-error logic.
5. **Either** ‚Äì return structured, descriptive error information.

üëâ **Core idea:**  
Functional error handling replaces `null` and exceptions with **typed, composable, immutable values** (`Option`,
`Either`) that make failure explicit, predictable, and easy to combine.

# Chapter 7, Requirements as types

# Chapter Summary ‚Äì Newtypes and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)

## 1. Newtypes and ADTs Overview

- **ADTs (Algebraic Data Types)**:
    - **Sum types** ‚Üí `enum` in Scala.
    - **Product types** ‚Üí `case class` in Scala.
- Used to represent **immutable, domain-specific data** safely.
- **Pattern matching** enables clear handling of ADTs in pure functions.
- Compared ADTs with **OOP inheritance**, showing ADTs are more explicit and safer.
- Learned new **higher-order functions** (on `Option`, `List`, etc.) as design tools.

## 2. Model Immutable Data to Minimize Errors

- Avoid primitive obsession: replace raw types with **newtypes** or **domain-specific ADTs**.
- Reduces mistakes and makes models reflect business logic accurately.

## 3. Model Requirements as Immutable Data

- ADTs can serve as **input parameters** to functions, improving safety and readability.
- Function signatures become **self-documenting**, reflecting possible states and outcomes.

## 4. Find Problems in Requirements Using the Compiler

- The compiler becomes a **design ally**, catching logical and structural errors early.
- Replacing primitives with **newtypes/ADTs** improves type safety and prevents invalid states.

## 5. Ensure Logic Runs Only on Valid Data

- Detailed data modeling makes invalid states **impossible to represent**.
- Eliminates many runtime checks and reduces the need for `Either`-based error handling.
- This approach is called **compile-time error prevention** ‚Äî superior to runtime handling when applicable.

## 6. Relationship Between ADTs and Either

- Both ADTs and `Either` can represent alternatives or branching logic.
- ADTs offer **compile-time guarantees**, while `Either` handles **runtime** validation.

üëâ **Core idea:**  
Functional design uses **newtypes and ADTs** to create precise, immutable, type-safe models. This enables the compiler
to enforce correctness, replacing many runtime errors with **compile-time safety** ‚Äî a cornerstone of robust functional
programming.

# Chapter 8, IO as values

# Chapter Summary ‚Äì IO and Purely Functional Side Effects

## 1. Represent Side Effects as Values

- **Side-effectful programs** can be represented as **values** using the `IO` type.
- Two main constructors:
    - `IO.delay` ‚Üí takes a lazily evaluated block of code (deferred execution).
    - `IO.pure` ‚Üí wraps an already computed value (eager execution, always succeeds).
- These allow **purely functional descriptions of impure operations**.

## 2. Handle Unsafe External Data Sources

- External APIs are **unsafe**‚Äîthey can fail unpredictably.
- We handle such calls safely by **describing recovery strategies** using:
    - `IO.orElse` for fallbacks and retries.
- Concepts from `Option` and `Either` helped us reason about **IO failures** in a familiar way.

## 3. Safely Persist Data Outside the Program

- Writing data (e.g., storing meetings) is also a side effect.
- Wrapped those operations in `IO.delay`, deferring execution.
- The side effects are only executed when explicitly invoked via:
    - `unsafeRunSync()` ‚Äî at the program‚Äôs boundary, not in the core logic.

## 4. Make Side Effects Explicit in Function Signatures

- Function signatures **reveal behavior**:
    - `List[MeetingTime]` ‚Üí pure, no side effects.
    - `IO[Option[MeetingTime]]` ‚Üí may perform IO operations when executed.
- This transparency improves readability, testability, and maintainability.

## 5. Separate Pure and Impure Code

- Introduced the **Functional Core, Imperative Shell** concept:
    - Core ‚Üí pure, deterministic logic.
    - Shell ‚Üí handles side effects (IO actions like HTTP calls or console output).
- Clients decide *where and when* to execute IO effects.

## 6. Additional Insights

- Covered only **synchronous programs** here; same ideas extend to **multi-threaded** ones.
- **Retries and fallbacks** may be part of the **business logic** (especially for output actions).
- Emphasized **essential vs. accidental concerns**:
    - Keep essential logic in the pure functional core.
    - Push accidental complexity (like IO) to the edges.

üëâ **Core idea:**  
Representing side effects as **first-class values (`IO`)** lets us write programs that are **pure, composable, and
testable**, while still capable of performing real-world actions safely and predictably.

# Chapter 9, Streams as values

Stream-based programming is widely used in several contexts:

- **UI programming:**  
  Streams model user interactions (e.g., clicks, gestures) as event sequences, similar to processing a currency stream.

- **Distributed computing:**  
  Producers and consumers often operate at different speeds on separate nodes.  
  Reactive streams (introduced in **Java 9‚Äôs `Flow` API**) provide mechanisms for **backpressure** and coordination.

- **Big data processing:**  
  Streams are ideal for handling data sets too large for memory.  
  Used in systems like **Hadoop** and **Spark**, as well as for geographic data, infinite feeds, and massive files.

No matter the domain, **core stream operations** (like `map`, `filter`, `zip`, etc.) remain applicable across libraries
and languages. Only names differ‚Äîyour intuition about how streams work will transfer easily.

### a. Declarative Program Flow Design

- Built complex flows **declaratively** using stream combinators:
    - `map`, `filter`, `append`, `eval`, `take`, `orElse`, `sliding`, `zip`, `zipLeft`, `repeat`, `unNone`.
- Leveraged **immutable maps** and **tuples** for predictable, side-effect-free transformations.

### b. Recursion and Laziness

- Used **recursion** to restart processes‚Äîparticularly for IO retries and recovery.
- Employed **laziness** to **defer computations** until necessary, optimizing both performance and control flow.

### c. Handling IO-Based Streams

- Distinguished between **pure streams** (e.g., of integers) and **IO streams** (side-effectful computations).
- Applied similar functional patterns to both, unifying their handling through abstraction.

### d. Infinite Streams

- Utilized **lazy evaluation** to create **infinite streams** safely and efficiently.
- Controlled them using stream operators (`take`, `zip`, etc.) to avoid unbounded execution.

### e. Time-Dependent Streams

- Modeled **time-based events** using a stream of `Unit` values emitted every second.
- Combined it (via `zip`) with another stream (e.g., API calls) to **produce outputs at fixed intervals**.
- This introduced the foundation of **multi-threaded and concurrent programming**.

üëâ **Core takeaway:**  
Streams offer a **unified, declarative, and composable** way to model asynchronous, time-dependent, and potentially
infinite computations‚Äîpaving the way toward functional **concurrency and reactive programming**.
