# Accelerate - Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organisations by Nicole Fergrson

# Chapter 1

* Why Technology Performance Matters

Companies that adopt modern software development and DevOps practices consistently outperform their competitors.
The ability to deliver software quickly, reliably, and safely is a key differentiator in today‚Äôs business world.

* Debunking the Trade-Off Myth

Traditional thinking suggests that companies must choose between speed (fast delivery) and stability (reliable systems).
Research proves that the best organizations achieve both speed and stability simultaneously.

* Measuring Software Delivery Performance

The authors introduce four key metrics that define high-performance teams:
Deployment Frequency (How often code is released)
Lead Time for Changes (Time from code commit to production)
Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) (How fast issues are resolved)
Change Failure Rate (Percentage of deployments causing issues)

* The Power of DevOps & Lean Practices

Adopting DevOps and Lean principles‚Äîlike automation, continuous delivery, and cross-team collaboration‚Äîleads to better
software delivery.

* Main Takeaway
  The chapter challenges old assumptions and shows that high-performing teams can move fast and maintain stability. The
  book aims to provide data-driven insights into what makes great software teams successful.

# Chapter 2: Measuring Performance

üöÄ High-performing teams deploy multiple times per day, have short lead times (hours or minutes), recover quickly, and
have low failure rates.

üê¢ Low-performing teams have long release cycles (weeks or months), slow recovery times, and frequent failures.

1. The Four Key Metrics
    * Deployment Frequency ‚Äì How often an organization successfully releases software.
    * Lead Time for Changes ‚Äì The time it takes for a code change to go from commit to production.
    * Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) ‚Äì How quickly a team can recover from failures.
    * Change Failure Rate ‚Äì The percentage of deployments that cause incidents requiring fixes.

2. Moving Beyond Traditional Metrics
   Traditional software success metrics (e.g., lines of code, number of commits, or hours worked) do not accurately
   reflect delivery performance.
   Instead, focusing on the four key DevOps metrics leads to better business outcomes.
3. Stability vs. Speed: A False Trade-Off
   Many believe that faster releases lead to unstable systems, but the research shows that high-performing teams achieve
   both speed and stability.
   Good DevOps practices (e.g., automated testing, continuous integration, and trunk-based development) help teams
   release quickly without compromising reliability.

4. Main Takeaway
   The four key DevOps metrics are the best indicators of software delivery success. High-performing teams focus on
   frequent deployments, fast recovery, and low failure rates rather than outdated productivity measures.

# Chapter 3: MEASURING AND CHANGING CULTURE

1. Organization culture, three levels of culture:
    * Basic assumptions: Invisible, things that we just ‚Äúknow‚Äù.
    * Values: more ‚Äúvisible‚Äù.
    * Artifacts:
        * Mission statements.
        * Technology.
        * Formal procedures.
        * Heroes.
        * Rituals.
        * Focus on second level.
2. Ron Westrum, three types:
   +------------------------------+---------------+----------------+------------------+
   | | Pathological | Bureaucratic | Generative |
   +------------------------------+---------------+----------------+------------------+
   | Power Orientation | Power-oriented | Rule-oriented | Performance-oriented |
   | Cooperation Level | Low | Modest | High |
   | Handling of Messengers | "Shot"        | Neglected | Trained |
   | Responsibility Approach | Shirked | Narrow | Shared |
   | Bridging Between Teams | Discouraged | Tolerated | Encouraged |
   | Response to Failure | Scapegoating | Justice | Inquiry |
   | Approach to Novelty | Crushed | Leads to problems | Implemented |
   +------------------------------+---------------+----------------+------------------+

3. Good information flow is critical:
    * Answers what and when needs to be answered, in a way that can be effectively used.
4. Org culture predicts performance outcomes.
5. Bureaucracy is not bad. Ensures fairness.
6. Good culture:
    * Trust and cooperation.
    * Higher quality decision making.
    * Easy to reverse bad decisions.
    * Higher job satisfaction.
    * Change culture by first changing what people do, not try to first change how people think (John Shook).

# Chapter 4 - Technical Practices

**Not optional, not secondary.**

## Key Principles of Continuous Delivery (CD):

- **Build quality in.**
- **Small batches.**
- **People solve problems, computers do repetitive tasks.**
- **Continuous improvement.**
- **Everyone is responsible.**

## Foundations of Continuous Delivery:

- **Comprehensive configuration management:** Everything in **Version Control System (VCS)**.
- **Continuous Integration (CI).**
- **Continuous Testing.**
- **Jerry Weinberg:** *"Quality is value to some person."*

## CD Brings Higher Quality:

- **Less rework or unplanned work.**
- **Fewer bugs.**

## Practices:

### **Version Control**

- Includes **system and application configuration**.

### **Test Automation**

- **Reliable tests.**
- **Written by developers.**
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is important but **not mandatory**.
- **Test Data Management.**
