#book Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler
7/10 - should read, but all useful info can be put into 1 article

• When you have to add a feature to a program but the code is not structured in a convenient way,
first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature.

• Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be
self­checking.

• Refactoring changes the programs in small steps, so if you make a mistake, it is easy to find
where the bug is. This is the essence of the refactoring process: small changes and testing after
each change.

• Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans
can understand.

• When programming, follow the camping rule: Always leave the code base healthier than when you
found it.

• Refactoring (noun): a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to
understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.

• Refactoring (verb): to restructure software by applying a series of refactorings without changing
its observable behavior.

• If someone says their code was broken for a couple of days while they are refactoring, you can be
pretty sure they were not refactoring.

• You have to refactor when you run into ugly code—but excellent code needs plenty of refactoring
too.
