Stream Lead 101:

    Main Focus:
        From Individual Contributor to Manager. Stream's performance is much more valuable than your individual contribution

    Technical Expertise:
        Stream Lead possess strong technical knowledge relevant to the stream's domain which
        allows them to make informed decisions, provide guidance to the team, and ensure technical quality of deliverables.
        This include being aware of all current development processes and quality metrics.
        Stream Lead often participates in broader program planning discussions, providing their expertise and insights.
        In some cases, stream lead may be responsible for mentoring team members and fostering knowledge sharing within the stream.

    One-on-one meetings:
        1-1s allow human connection and it is an opportunity to speak privately as praise should be public and criticism should be private.
        Important: Document key points, don't rely on memory, for each report, keep a shared document as a log of the things that you discuss in your 1-1s.
        Frequency: Weekly is standard, adjust based on seniority and needs.
        2 Styles of 1-1:
            1) Todo list: One or both parties comes with a list of goals to cover in order of importance. This style is very professional and efficient, but sometimes is a bit cold. It forces reports to think beforehand what do they want to discuss.
            2) Catch Up: Listen to anything your reports want to discuss. Let them drive the meeting. It should be as much as a creative discussion as a planning meeting.
        Feedback Meeting: Focused on growth, quarterly is frequent enough to give the topic attention.
    
    Manage project scope and objectives:
        Stream Lead ensure the stream's deliverables align with the overall goals and stay within the defined scope.
        Stream Lead ensure the stream's refactorings stay within the defined scope.
        Stream Lead regularly communicate progress and identified risks to Team lead and project manager, keeping them updated on the stream's status and any deviations from the plan.
        Stream Lead proactively identify and address blockers/challenges within the stream, ensuring smooth progress.
        Stream Lead should continuously learn and adapt to ensure the stream utilizes the latest advancements in the field.
