## Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track by Will Larson 

### Overview

* At the career level, being promoted further is an exception rather than expected.

#### Staff Engineer Archetypes

* The four common archetypes are the _Tech Lead_, the _Architect_, the _Solver_, and the _Right Hand_.
* A _Tech Lead Manager_ is similar to the Tech Lead archetype but exists on the engineering management ladder and includes people management responsibilities.
