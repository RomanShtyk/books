#book Lencioniâ€™s 5 Dysfunctions of a Team
5/10, too much water
1) Absence of Trust +
   admitting your own weaknesses and limitations
2) Fear of Conflict
   Establish that conflict is welcome and purposeful
3) Lack of Commitment
   Clarity and closure are paramount to overcome this dysfunction
4) Avoidance of Team Accountability
   If teams have come this far, they have trust and commitment, then they will know that a team member calling them out not only has the right to do so because expectations and deadlines were clear, but that it is not a personal attack.
5) Inattention to Team Objectives
   When teams have a solid base of trust, healthy conflict, commitment and team accountability and are recognized within the company for performance via praise or rewards, it will be easier for team members to put their own needs aside for the sake of the team.
