## Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track by Will Larson

### Overview

* At the career level, being promoted further is an exception rather than expected.

### Staff Engineer Archetypes

* The four common archetypes are the _Tech Lead_, the _Architect_, the _Solver_, and the _Right Hand_.
* A _Tech Lead Manager_ is similar to the Tech Lead archetype but exists on the engineering management ladder and
  includes people management responsibilities.

##### Tech Lead

* Tech Leads are the most common archetype. They're comfortable scoping complex tasks, coordinating their team towards
  solving them, and unblocking them along the way.
* They maintain many essential cross-team and cross-functional relationships, and are a close partner to the team's
  product manager.
* A tech lead defaults to delegating tasks, thereby growing their teammates, but they still define the team's technical
  vision and step in to build alignment on technical issues.
* An organization needs roughly one tech lead for every eight engineers, and so they are the most common archetype.
* A Staff-engineer is the intersection of your role, your behaviors, your impact, and the organization's recognition of
  all these things.

##### Architect

* Architects are responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within their company.
* For a domain to merit an architect, it must be both complex and enduringly central to the company's success.
* Influential architects dedicate their energy to maintaining and intimate understanding of the business' needs, the
  users' goals, and the relevant technical constraints.
* The architect role emerges in large companies, those with extremely complex codebases, and in companies struggling to
  repay technical debt created in their sprint to product-market fit.

##### Solver

* The Solver is a trusted agent of the company who goes deep into knotty problems, continuing to work on them until
  they're resolved.
* They generally stop working on problems once they're contained, which creates a feeling of transience and requires a
  soft touch to avoid upsetting the teams left to maintain the "solved" problem.
* The solver is most common in companies that think of individuals, rather than teams, as the atomic unit of planning
  and ownership.

##### Right Hand

* The Right Hand is the least common of the archetypes, showing up as an organization reaches hundreds of engineers.
  They operate as a senior organizational leader without direct managerial responsibilities.
* Borrowing authority comes with the obligation to remain deeply aligned with that leader's approach, beliefs, and
  values.
* Problems addressed at this level are never purely technical and instead involve the intersection of business,
  technology, people, culture, and process.
* The joy of these roles is that you work only on essential problems. The tragedy is that you're on to the next issue by
  the time those problems are solved.

##### Which is right for you?

* Success in these roles requires remaining engaged, so it's essential to understand what kind of work energizes you.
* The Tech Lead and Architect may work with the same people and on the same problem for years, developing a tight sense
  of team and shared purpose.
* The Solver and Right Hand bounce from fire to fire, often having only transactional interactions with the folks
  they're working with on any given week.

#### What do Staff engineers actually do?

* All archetypes set and edit technical direction, provide sponsorship and mentorship, inject engineering context into
  organizational decisions, exploration, and be glue.

##### Setting technical direction

* Think of setting technical direction as being a part-time product manager for technology.
* Setting technical direction is far more about understanding and solving the real needs of the organization around you
  and far less about prioritizing technology approaches that you're personally excited to learn about.

##### Mentorship and sponsorship

* You're far more likely to change your company's long term trajectory by growing other engineers than through personal
  heroics.
* The most effective Staff engineers pair a moderate amount of mentorship with considerably more sponsorship.

##### Providing engineering perspective

* Staff-plus engineers are the folks who will often get unexpectedly pulled into the room when time-sensitive or
  important decisions are happening.
* Such brief moments of input on critical decisions are unduly impactful and will allow you to inject an engineering
  perspective where it would otherwise be missed.

##### Exploration

* Staff-engineers may be assigned to do exploratory work, which is any ambiguous, important problem that the company's
  systems are ill-shaped to address.
* It takes a great deal of organizational trust to be trusted with this work, including having enough respect from the
  business that if you fail, it's a reflection on the problem and not you.

##### Being glue

* Staff engineers often do the needed, but often invisible, tasks to keep the team moving forward and shipping its work.

##### But will you still write software?

* Staff engineers don't write as much software as they did earlier in their career.
* If a Staff engineer finds themselves coding often, it's usually a sign of working on something comfortable rather than
  something important.

##### Slow but rewarding

* Most of the work you'll be doing at this level replaces the feedback loop with one that takes weeks, months, and
  years.

#### Does the title even matter?

* Three consistent advantages that generally come with being a Staff-plus title are:
    * allowing you to bypass informal gauges of seniority
    * facilitating access to "the room"
    * increase in current and career compensation

##### Informal gauges of seniority

* A Staff-plus title allows you to re-invest the energy you've previously spent on proving yourself into the core work
  you're evaluated on.

##### Being in the room

* In more senior roles, you can provide input when it's relatively cheap to incorporate, because the roll out or
  implementation has not advanced too far.

##### Compensation

* Even if your current company doesn't compensate for Staff-plus engineer roles much differently than for Senior
  engineer roles, some companies do.

##### Access to interesting work

* Being a Staff-plus engineer does not necessarily give you access to interesting work. For example, as a tech lead you
  may be undermining your team if you operate that way.
* The most consistently effective way to get access to interesting work is being hired to do it.
* As a Staff engineer, you cannot pursue interesting work out of personal interest â€“ you must put the business' needs
  first, and to model good behavior.

##### Different rather than better

* Many folks find that their Staff role's heightened expectations eliminate the work that used to excite them.

##### Material but not magic

* If you have a problem and believe that your title is the only thing holding you back, rest assured that focusing on
  developing your approach and skills will be far more impactful than the title.
* However, women and minorities often do find they spend significantly less time and energy proving themselves once they
  attain a Staff-plus title.

### Operating at Staff

* A big part of the learning curve of Staff engineer is that much of the work you're doing has a much slower feedback
  cycle.

#### Work on what matters

* If you're continuing to advance your career, then even as your time available for work shrinks, the expectations
  around your impact will keep growing.
* Only through pacing your career to your life can you sustain yourself in the long term.

##### Avoiding snacking

* When you run out of easy and high-impact work, only hard and high-impact work or easy and low-impact work is left. The
  latter choice is *snacking*.
* In senior roles, you're more likely to self-determine your work. If you're not deliberately tracking your work then
  it's easy to catch yourself doing little to no high-impact work.

##### Stop preening

* Preening is the seductive subset of snacking that is low-impact, high-visibility work.
* Many companies can't distinguish between preening and impact, leading senior engineers to do work of dubious value
  that is frequently recognized in company meetings.
* To be a successful preener requires near invulnerability to criticism of your actual impact, and your true work will
  suffer if your energy is diverted to preening.

##### Stop chasing ghosts

* After joining a new company, taking the time to understand the status quo before shifting it will always repay
  diligence with results.

##### Existential issues

* Companies operate in an eternal iterative elimination tournament, balancing future success against surviving until
  that future becomes the present.
* If you're about to lose one of those rounds, then always focus there.

##### Work where there's room _and_ attention

* The most effective places to work are those that matter to your company but still have enough room to actually do
  work.
* Teaching a company to value something it doesn't care about is the hardest soft of work you can do, and it often
  fails, so you should do as little of it as you can, but no less.

##### Foster growth

* If you start dedicating a few hours per week to developing the team around you, it's quite likely that will become
  your legacy long after your tech specs and pull requests are forgotten.

##### Edit

* With your organizational privilege, relationships, and ability to see around corners derived from your experience, you
  can often shift a project's outcomes by investing the smallest amount of effort.

##### Finish things

* We only get value from finishing projects, and getting a project over the finish line is the magical moment it goes
  from risk to leverage.

##### What only you can

* The final category of work that matters is the work you're uniquely capable of accomplishing, which is an intersection
  of what you're exceptionally good at and what you genuinely care about.

##### Why it matters

* Interviewing judges you on subjective measures like your accumulated prestige, your titles at companies you've worked
  at, your backchannel reputation, and how you present yourself in the interview process.
* The only viable long-term bet on your career is focusing on work that matters, doing projects that develop you, and
  steering yourself toward companies that value genuine experience.

#### Writing engineering strategy

* To write an engineering strategy, write five design documents and pull the similarities out. That's your engineering
  strategy.
* To write an engineering vision, write five engineering strategies, and forecast their implications two years into the
  future. That's your engineering vision.
* Engineering strategy and vision are the output of iterative, bottom-up organizational learning.

##### When and why

* If you're rehashing the same discussion multiple times, it's time to write an engineering strategy.
* When the future's too hazy to identify investments worth making, it's time to write another vision.

##### Write five design docs

* A batch of design docs is the ideal ingredient for writing an effective strategy because they have what bad strategies
  lack: detailed specifics grounded in reality.
* A few recommendations as you write:
    * Prefer minimal design document templates that allow authors to select the most useful sections and only insist on
      exhaustive details for the riskiest projects.
    * Gather perspectives widely but write alone. Don't fall in love with what you've written until *after* you've
      reviewed it with others.
    * Focusing on pushing designs to be good, rather than fixating on your own best as the relevant quality bar.

##### Synthesize those five design docs into a strategy

* Good strategies guide tradeoffs and explain the rationale behind that guidance. Bad strategies set policy without
  explanation.
* Some advice for writing a strategy document:
    * Be specific, and if you can't be specific, wait until you've written more design documents. Specific statements
      create alignment.
    * Be opinionated, or else the document won't provide any clarity on decision making.
    * Show the rationale behind your opinions, so that others can modify and extend your work as the underlying context
      shifts.

##### Extrapolate five strategies into a vision

* Some advice for writing a useful vision:
    * Write two to three years out, or expand a bit longer if you're at a fairly-established company.
    * Ground it in serving your business and your users. Bad visions are grounded in technical sophistication, which
      isn't aligned with leadership's goals.
    * Be ambitious but not audacious. Write what you could do if every project finished on time, and not what would be
      possible with unlimited resources.
    * Stay concrete and specific. Details in visions are often illustrative rather than declarative, giving a taste of a
      future rather than a binding commitment.

#### Managing technical quality

* At a well-run and successful company, most of your previous technical decisions won't meet your current quality
  threshold.
* Rather than a failure, closing the gap between your current and target technical quality is a routine, essential part
  of effective engineering leadership.
