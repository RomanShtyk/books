## Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track by Will Larson 

### Overview

* At the career level, being promoted further is an exception rather than expected.

#### Staff Engineer Archetypes

* The four common archetypes are the _Tech Lead_, the _Architect_, the _Solver_, and the _Right Hand_.
* A _Tech Lead Manager_ is similar to the Tech Lead archetype but exists on the engineering management ladder and includes people management responsibilities.

##### Tech Lead

* Tech Leads are the most common archetype. They're comfortable scoping complex tasks, coordinating their team towards solving them, and unblocking them along the way.
* They maintain many essential cross-team and cross-functional relationships, and are a close partner to the team's product manager.
* A tech lead defaults to delegating tasks, thereby growing their teammates, but they still define the team's technical vision and step in to build alignment on technical issues.
* An organization needs roughly one tech lead for every eight engineers, and so they are the most common archetype.
* A Staff-engineer is the intersection of your role, your behaviors, your impact, and the organization's recognition of all these things.

##### Architect

* Architects are responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within their company.
* For a domain to merit an architect, it must be both complex and enduringly central to the company's success.
* Influential architects dedicate their energy to maintaining and intimate understanding of the business' needs, the users' goals, and the relevant technical constraints.
* The architect role emerges in large companies, those with extremely complex codebases, and in companies struggling to repay technical debt created in their sprint to product-market fit.

##### Solver

* The Solver is a trusted agent of the company who goes deep into knotty problems, continuing to work on them until they're resolved.
* They generally stop working on problems once they're contained, which creates a feeling of transience and requires a soft touch to avoid upsetting the teams left to maintain the "solved" problem.
* The solver is most common in companies that think of individuals, rather than teams, as the atomic unit of planning and ownership.

##### Right Hand

* The Right Hand is the least common of the archetypes, showing up as an organization reaches hundreds of engineers. They operate as a senior organizational leader without direct managerial responsibilities.
* Borrowing authority comes with the obligation to remain deeply aligned with that leader's approach, beliefs, and values.
* Problems addressed at this level are never purely technical and instead involve the intersection of business, technology, people, culture, and process.
* The joy of these roles is that you work only on essential problems. The tragedy is that you're on to the next issue by the time those problems are solved.

##### Which is right for you?

* Success in these roles requires remaining engaged, so it's essential to understand what kind of work energizes you.
* The Tech Lead and Architect may work with the same people and on the same problem for years, developing a tight sense of team and shared purpose.
* The Solver and Right Hand bounce from fire to fire, often having only transactional interactions with the folks they're working with on any given week.
