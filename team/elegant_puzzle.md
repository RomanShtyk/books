# An Elegant Puzzle Systems of Engineering Management Will Larson

#### Organizations

* Manager should support six to eight engineers.
* Tech Lead Managers - managers supporting fewer than four engineers tend to function as TLMs, taking on a share of
  design and implementation work.
* Managers supporting more than eight or nine engineers typically act as coaches adn safety nets for problems. They are
  to busy to actively invest in their team or their teams area of responsibility.
* Managers of managers should support four to six managers.
* On-call rotations want a team of at least eight engineers to rotate efficiently.
* Small teams (fewer than four members) are not teams.
* To create a new team, grow an existing team to eight to ten, and then into two teams of four or five.

* Four states of team:

        * Falling behind - backlog grows;
        * Treading water - critical work done, techdebt - no; WIP - work in progress
        * Repaying techdebt - they are able to start repaying debt and beginning to benefit from debt repayment
          snowball:
          each piece of debt you repay leads to more time to repay more debt.
