#book The Manager’s Path by Camille Fournier

Focus:  From Individual Contributor to Manager

It's a Different Job: Management isn't about doing the technical work better; it's about empowering
others. Success is measured by your team's output.
Don't Assume It's the Right Path: The book encourages honest reflection about why you want to pursue
management. Are you motivated by the genuine desire to lead, mentor, and help others grow?
The Skills Shift: The technical expertise that made you a star individual contributor is still
valuable, but it becomes one tool in a broader set of skills needed as a manager: communication,
delegation, conflict resolution, feedback, and more

Core Concepts Introduced:
One-on-Ones: The importance of having regular, structured one-on-one meetings with your team members
for building rapport, understanding priorities, and offering feedback.
Feedback: Giving regular, timely feedback (both positive and constructive) is crucial for a team's
development and to avoid potential surprises.
Delegation: The importance of effectively delegating tasks to develop your team members, and the
trust this process requires.

Mentoring: The Essentials

Mutual Benefit: Mentoring grows skills in both mentor and mentee.
Be Intentional: Tailor your approach to the mentee's role (intern, new hire, etc.)
Invest Early: Provide close support initially, especially for interns.
Listen Actively: Build empathy and communication skills.
Mentoring for Career Growth

Best Fit: Seek natural mentoring situations within existing work.
Mentee Prepares: Clearly defined goals and session preparation are crucial for success.
Mentoring ≠ Everything: Consider other resources (coaching, therapy) for broader needs.

The Alpha Geek: Avoid This

Set Measurable Goals: Define what successful mentoring looks like.
Recognize Mentors: Publicly acknowledge their time and effort.
Choose Wisely: Mentoring may impact productivity; select individuals with leadership potential.
Mentor Takeaways

Stay Open-Minded: Learn from your mentees as they learn from you.
Adapt Communication: Practice explaining complex concepts clearly.
Build Your Network: Mentoring relationships strengthen your professional connections.

Tech lead:
Not Just Skill Based: Senior-level engineers can become tech leads, regardless of being the
absolute 'best' coder.
Leadership Focus: Prioritize enabling the team's productivity over individual technical dominance.
Project Management: It's essential for breaking down large tasks, even if the team doesn't have a
dedicated project manager.

Key Roles of a Tech Lead:
System Architect: Understand the big picture to guide design decisions.
Planner: Break down projects, manage unknowns, and create plans that can be iterated on and adapted.
Developer & Team Leader: Continue to code, but also guide the team and delegate effectively.
Mentor: Facilitate others' growth through feedback and support.

Essential Skills:
Communication: Clear, consistent communication is more important than pure technical brilliance.
Balancing Priorities: Manage your own coding tasks with overseeing the team, resolving blockers, and
protecting focus time.
Influence & Empowerment: Lead without direct authority; focus on the team's success more than your
own contributions.
Process Adaptability: Tailor processes to the team's needs, rather than trying to impose a
one-size-fits all approach.

Valuable Practices:
Explain, don't diminish: Take time to share knowledge with the team.
Pre-plan AND Iterate: Planning is crucial, but be ready to adapt as the project unfolds.
Regular 1:1s: Provide structured feedback and mentorship for team members.
