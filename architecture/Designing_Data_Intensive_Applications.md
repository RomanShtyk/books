Designing Data Intensive Applications by
In this book, we focus on three concerns that are important in most software systems:

**Reliability**
The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even
in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults, and even human error).

**Scalability**
As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing with
that growth.

**Maintainability**
Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current
behavior and adapting the system to new use cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.

Operations teams are vital to keeping a software system running smoothly. A good operations team typically is
responsible for the following, and more:
• Monitoring the health of the system and quickly restoring service if it goes into a bad state
• Tracking down the cause of problems, such as system failures or degraded performance
• Keeping software and platforms up to date, including security patches
• Keeping tabs on how different systems affect each other, so that a problematic change can be avoided before it causes
damage
• Anticipating future problems and solving them before they occur (e.g., capacity planning)
• Establishing good practices and tools for deployment, configuration management, and more
• Performing complex maintenance tasks, such as moving an application from one platform to another
• Maintaining the security of the system as configuration changes are made
• Defining processes that make operations predictable and help keep the production environment stable
• Preserving the organization’s knowledge about the system, even as individual people come and go
