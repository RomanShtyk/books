Domain Driven Design Quickly [Marinescu, Floyd, Avram, Abel]:
7/10 - not bad, gives some common sense rules for architecture design

The Ubiquitous Language - glossary for devs and business people

Entity is unique object with identity

Value object in not meant to be entity but must be immutable

Donâ€™t make huge objects, divide properties by concept (address, personalInfo, etc.)

*Communicational cohesion and Functional cohesion*

Customer-supplier pattern for team that depend on another team

*Anti corruption layer

Boil down domain into small core

Stay hands-on. Modelers need to code.

Focus on concrete scenarios. Abstract thinking has to be
anchored in concrete cases.

Don't try to apply DDD to everything. Draw a context map
and decide on where you will make a push for DDD and where
you will not. And then don't worry about it outside those
boundaries.

Experiment a lot and expect to make lots of mistakes.
Modeling is a creative process.
