The Amateur's Mind by Jeremy Silman

List of Imbalances:

* Minor Pieces — the interplay between Bishops and Knights (trying to make one superior to the other).
* Pawn Structure — a broad subject that encompasses doubled pawns, isolated pawns, backward pawns, passed pawns, etc.
* Space — the annexation of territory on a chess board.
* Material — owning pieces of greater value than the opponent's.
* Files and squares — files, ranks, and diagonals act as pathways for your pieces, while squares act as homes. Whole
  plans can center around the domination of a file, or the creation of a weak square in the enemy camp.
* Development — a lead in development gives you more force in a specific area of the board. This is a temporary
  imbalance because the opponent will eventually catch up.
* Initiative — dictating the tempo of a game. This is also a temporary imbalance.

Rules of minor pieces:

1) Both 3 points
2) Bishops are best on open space where pawns are not blocking their diagonals
3) Bishops are strong in endgames where both sides have passed pawns. Long range makes them far superior to short-range
   Knights
4) Term "Bad Bishop" means that your bishop is on the same color as your central pawns. Even bad bishop can be a very
   strong piece if it is outside a pawn chain
5) Bishop weakness is that it is stuck on the same color. Pair of bishops working together can negate this
6) Knights love closed positions with locked pawns
7) Knights usually better in the center of the board
8) Knight has to have an outpost to be effective
   8.5) Knight is the best on 6th rank controlling the most crucial squares
9) Knight is superior to bishop in endgame if all pawns are on the one side of the board
10) Best way to counter a knight is to get rid of outposts, hence making outpost is a priority if you have a knight

Tips

* The imbalance of Bishop versus Knight is of vital importance. If you have the Bishop you must strive to take away all
  the advanced posts from the enemy Knight. If you have the Knight you must fight to create a good home for the horse
  and to create situations where the Bishop is not particularly useful.
* Bishop versus Knight does not necessarily favor one piece or the other; you must plant the seeds which allow your
  piece to prosper. The same holds true for all the other imbalances. If you don't recognize and use it, you will find
  that this so-called advantage won't do you any good.
* You must take your opponent's possibilities into account!
* Don't ever play a quick, thoughtless move. That will usually turn out to be the move that ruins your game.

Tips

* If the integrity of your position is based on a one-mover like ...Qxg2 mate, then you are dead meat since such an
  obvious threat is usually easy to parry. Instead, you should nurture long-range plusses like material, superior minor
  pieces, etc.
* When you find yourself crossing your fingers and hoping he won’t see it, you know that you are in desperate trouble!
* Once a minor piece imbalance is established, you must play with great energy to make that imbalance favor you.

Tips

* Always expect the best move
* If you have 2 bishops, try to open up the position
* Rules are useful, but every rule was made to be broken...
* Create a plan right away
* bishops are really better in pawn race endgames

#### The center, territory and space

Rule 1: full pawn center gives control over key squares
Rule 2: full pawn center is responsibility, when you achieve it - make it indestructible
Rule 3: do not advance the center too early, every pawn move leaves a weakness
Rule 4: strive to attack full center
Rule 5: if central pawns are traded than open file exists for rooks
Rule 6: if center is blocked - play switches to the wings
Rule 7: if center is blocked - play on the wing your pawn are pointing
Rule 7.5: push the pawn that stand next to your most advance pawn
Rule 8: A wide open center allows you to attack with pieces. A closed center generally means that you must attack with
pawns (this enables you to grab space and open files for your Rooks)

#### Rules of space:

1) if you have more space - better to avoid exchanges
2) spatial plus is a permanent advantage, no need to hurry to utilize it

Tips:

* Try and appraise your position honestly.
* Never give up hope! A positive fighter’s attitude will bring you points even from the most hopeless-looking situation.
* Look to the center for play. Chess is not just a bunch of battles on the wings.
* Passive, planless play will lead to a loss every time.
* Know what the opponent is planning at all times but don’t allow yourself to become mesmerized by his ideas.
  Ultimately, your plans should prove to be stronger than his.
* Don’t make pointless one-move attacks. If you are crossing your fingers and hoping he doesn’t see it, you are making
  the wrong move (you are also building bad mental habits). Always expect your opponent to see your threats! You want to
  play a move that improves your position no matter what he does. I tend to repeat this a lot, but I find it’s a mistake
  that the amateur makes over and over again.
