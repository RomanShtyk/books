The Amateur's Mind by Jeremy Silman

List of Imbalances:

* Minor Pieces — the interplay between Bishops and Knights (trying to make one superior to the other).
* Pawn Structure — a broad subject that encompasses doubled pawns, isolated pawns, backward pawns, passed pawns, etc.
* Space — the annexation of territory on a chess board.
* Material — owning pieces of greater value than the opponent's.
* Files and squares — files, ranks, and diagonals act as pathways for your pieces, while squares act as homes. Whole
  plans can center around the domination of a file, or the creation of a weak square in the enemy camp.
* Development — a lead in development gives you more force in a specific area of the board. This is a temporary
  imbalance because the opponent will eventually catch up.
* Initiative — dictating the tempo of a game. This is also a temporary imbalance.

Rules of minor pieces:

1) Both 3 points
2) Bishops are best on open space where pawns are not blocking their diagonals
3) Bishops are strong in endgames where both sides have passed pawns. Long range makes them far superior to short-range
   Knights
4) Term "Bad Bishop" means that your bishop is on the same color as your central pawns. Even bad bishop can be a very
   strong piece if it is outside a pawn chain
5) Bishop weakness is that it is stuck on the same color. Pair of bishops working together can negate this
6) Knights love closed positions with locked pawns
7) Knights usually better in the center of the board
8) Knight has to have an outpost to be effective
   8.5) Knight is the best on 6th rank controlling the most crucial squares
9) Knight is superior to bishop in endgame if all pawns are on the one side of the board
10) Best way to counter a knight is to get rid of outposts, hence making outpost is a priority if you have a knight

Tips

* The imbalance of Bishop versus Knight is of vital importance. If you have the Bishop you must strive to take away all
  the advanced posts from the enemy Knight. If you have the Knight you must fight to create a good home for the horse
  and to create situations where the Bishop is not particularly useful.
* Bishop versus Knight does not necessarily favor one piece or the other; you must plant the seeds which allow your
  piece to prosper. The same holds true for all the other imbalances. If you don't recognize and use it, you will find
  that this so-called advantage won't do you any good.
* You must take your opponent's possibilities into account!
* Don't ever play a quick, thoughtless move. That will usually turn out to be the move that ruins your game.

Tips

* If the integrity of your position is based on a one-mover like ...Qxg2 mate, then you are dead meat since such an
  obvious threat is usually easy to parry. Instead, you should nurture long-range plusses like material, superior minor
  pieces, etc.
* When you find yourself crossing your fingers and hoping he won’t see it, you know that you are in desperate trouble!
* Once a minor piece imbalance is established, you must play with great energy to make that imbalance favor you.
