The Amateur's Mind by Jeremy Silman

#### List of Imbalances:

* Minor Pieces — the interplay between Bishops and Knights (trying to make one superior to the other).
* Pawn Structure — a broad subject that encompasses doubled pawns, isolated pawns, backward pawns, passed pawns, etc.
* Space — the annexation of territory on a chess board.
* Material — owning pieces of greater value than the opponent's.
* Files and squares — files, ranks, and diagonals act as pathways for your pieces, while squares act as homes. Whole
  plans can center around the domination of a file, or the creation of a weak square in the enemy camp.
* Development — a lead in development gives you more force in a specific area of the board. This is a temporary
  imbalance because the opponent will eventually catch up.
* Initiative — dictating the tempo of a game. This is also a temporary imbalance.

#### Rules of minor pieces:

1) Both 3 points
2) Bishops are best on open space where pawns are not blocking their diagonals
3) Bishops are strong in endgames where both sides have passed pawns. Long range makes them far superior to short-range
   Knights
4) Term "Bad Bishop" means that your bishop is on the same color as your central pawns. Even bad bishop can be a very
   strong piece if it is outside a pawn chain
5) Bishop weakness is that it is stuck on the same color. Pair of bishops working together can negate this
6) Knights love closed positions with locked pawns
7) Knights usually better in the center of the board
8) Knight has to have an outpost to be effective
   8.5) Knight is the best on 6th rank controlling the most crucial squares
9) Knight is superior to bishop in endgame if all pawns are on the one side of the board
10) Best way to counter a knight is to get rid of outposts, hence making outpost is a priority if you have a knight

Tips

* The imbalance of Bishop versus Knight is of vital importance. If you have the Bishop you must strive to take away all
  the advanced posts from the enemy Knight. If you have the Knight you must fight to create a good home for the horse
  and to create situations where the Bishop is not particularly useful.
* Bishop versus Knight does not necessarily favor one piece or the other; you must plant the seeds which allow your
  piece to prosper. The same holds true for all the other imbalances. If you don't recognize and use it, you will find
  that this so-called advantage won't do you any good.
* You must take your opponent's possibilities into account!
* Don't ever play a quick, thoughtless move. That will usually turn out to be the move that ruins your game.

Tips

* If the integrity of your position is based on a one-mover like ...Qxg2 mate, then you are dead meat since such an
  obvious threat is usually easy to parry. Instead, you should nurture long-range plusses like material, superior minor
  pieces, etc.
* When you find yourself crossing your fingers and hoping he won’t see it, you know that you are in desperate trouble!
* Once a minor piece imbalance is established, you must play with great energy to make that imbalance favor you.

Tips

* Always expect the best move
* If you have 2 bishops, try to open up the position
* Rules are useful, but every rule was made to be broken...
* Create a plan right away
* bishops are really better in pawn race endgames

#### The center, territory and space

Rule 1: full pawn center gives control over key squares
Rule 2: full pawn center is responsibility, when you achieve it - make it indestructible
Rule 3: do not advance the center too early, every pawn move leaves a weakness
Rule 4: strive to attack full center
Rule 5: if central pawns are traded than open file exists for rooks
Rule 6: if center is blocked - play switches to the wings
Rule 7: if center is blocked - play on the wing your pawn are pointing
Rule 7.5: push the pawn that stand next to your most advance pawn
Rule 8: A wide open center allows you to attack with pieces. A closed center generally means that you must attack with
pawns (this enables you to grab space and open files for your Rooks)

#### Rules of space:

1) if you have more space - better to avoid exchanges
2) spatial plus is a permanent advantage, no need to hurry to utilize it

Tips:

* Try and appraise your position honestly.
* Never give up hope! A positive fighter’s attitude will bring you points even from the most hopeless-looking situation.
* Look to the center for play. Chess is not just a bunch of battles on the wings.
* Passive, planless play will lead to a loss every time.
* Know what the opponent is planning at all times but don’t allow yourself to become mesmerized by his ideas.
  Ultimately, your plans should prove to be stronger than his.
* Don’t make pointless one-move attacks. If you are crossing your fingers and hoping he doesn’t see it, you are making
  the wrong move (you are also building bad mental habits). Always expect your opponent to see your threats! You want to
  play a move that improves your position no matter what he does. I tend to repeat this a lot, but I find it’s a mistake
  that the amateur makes over and over again.

Tips:

* Even a seemingly bad opening will have some positive points. If you don't take what your opponent is doing
  seriously, then these positive points will end up beating you.
* A plan comes before development.
* When you accept laziness into your mental processes, it becomes a habit that's hard to break. Work hard from the
  very first moves!
* If you think you see a win, but are worried about falling into a trap, you must be courageous and make him prove his
  point. Never let fear talk you out of a course of action.
* If you're going to worry about something, make sure
  it is worth worrying about!
* Games are often won by simply taking space and
  restricting the opponent's options. You don't have to attack like a wild man to score a point.
* Once you start a plan, make sure you finish it. Don't allow yourself to get sidetracked.
* If you own the center and are killing all the opponent's counterplay, there is no hurry to start an attack on the
  wing. Continue to take your time, gain and take away the enemy's options.

Tips:

* You can win games by just increasing your edge in territory bit by bit
* if you have space advantage, try to restrict the enemy pieces
* the side with more space should not trade too many pieces and vice-versa
* Don't be in rush to force things, A slow squeeze is enough to torture the opponent and force his eventual
  capitulation

Tips:

* Space advantage means little if there is no way to penetrate the enemy position
* Open files are precious things, don't close the very road you so desperately need.

Tips:

* Feel free to grab as much space as you can as long as you are not creating weaknesses in your position
* Don't allow a race if you don't have to
* It is a rarely good idea to keep your king in a center

#### Pawn structure

Doubled Pawns:

* NEGATIVE — The doubling of pawns reduces their flexibility and, at times, leaves one or both of them vulnerable to
  attack (though it’s usually the lead pawn that is the weaker).
* POSITIVE — The doubling of pawns leads to extra open files for your Rooks and increased square control.

Isolated Pawns:

* 1st NEGATIVE — An isolated pawn cannot be defended by another pawn and is very vulnerable to attack if it stands on an
  open file.
* 1st POSITIVE — The creation of an isolated pawn may bestow upon its owner the use of a half-open file.
* 2nd NEGATIVE — The formula to beat an isolated pawn calls for control of the weak square in front of the pawn so it
  can’t move, the trade of all minor pieces (which ends all attacking chances for the owner of the isolated pawn), the
  retention of a Queen (this stops the enemy King from taking part in the defense of the pawn) and one or two Rooks (
  which will be used to attack the pawn), the doubling of these pieces against the pawn and the use of a friendly pawn
  to attack the pinned isolated target.
* 2nd POSITIVE — an isolated pawn at d4(white)-d5(black)  gives his owner plenty of space and open files for his rooks.
  The owner should play for dynamic play with his pieces.

Backward pawns:

* NEGATIVE —— A backward pawn is only weak if it is sitting on an open file and if it is unable to advance. The side
  playing against the backward pawn should strive to control the square directly in front of it (turning it into an
  immobile target), since this square cannot be defended by a pawn. One way to do this is to exchange all the pieces
  that defend this square.
* POSITIVE —— A backward pawn acts as a guard to a more advanced pawn to the side of it. This advanced pawn can block
  enemy pieces and control important squares. The backward pawn cannot be considered a bad thing if the square in front
  of it is well-defended.

Hanging pawns:

* NEGATIVE This kind of structure can be weak if the other side is able to circumvent any dynamic advance of the pawn
  duo and, since the pawns would then be immobile, train the power of all his pieces against them.
* POSITIVE The traditional hanging pawns on c5 and d5 (or c4 and d4 if White has them) control many important central
  squares, give their owner an advantage in territory and also offer play on the half-open b-file and e-file.

Passed pawns:

* Negative - A protected passed pawn is not always an advantage, though most players think it is. If the square in front
  of the pawn can be controlled by the other side, then the pawn is stopped in its tracks and becomes a non-factor for a
  long time. Even worse, if this square falls to a Knight, then the horse will radiate power on the neighboring squares
  and pawns.
* Positive - A passed pawn is very strong if its owner has play elsewhere. Then it can be used as endgame insurance. A
  passed pawn is also strong if the square in front of it is cleared for the pawn's advance. As can be seen, when a
  passed pawn exists, the square in front of it becomes the most important square on the board. Whoever owns this square
  dominates the game, so great energy and imagination must be demonstrated by both sides if they want to wrest control
  of this critical point.

Tips:

* A weak pawn is really weak if you can seriously attack it or make use of a weak squares that may come with them
* Always play to improve your position. Don't panic and retreat from good squares.
* Owning hanging pawns means that you must play dynamically. Passive play will lead to your hanging pawns turning into
  weaknesses.
* If you are playing against hanging pawns, you must attack them with everything you've got.

Tips:

* Any kind of weak pawn must first be contained (blocked) before it is attacked.
* No pawn structure is always good or bad. Look for the potential plusses in any given structure and make sure the
  opponent doesn't achieve them.
* Though I repeat this in every chapter, I will take time to do so again: Don't just react to the opponent's plans. Find
  an active idea and follow it with as much energy as you can muster. On the other hand, don't get carried away with
  your own ideas and forget that you have an opponent. Take his plans into account and make adjustments when necessary.

Tips:

* A so-called weak pawn is only weak if it can be attacked! Each individual pawn has its own plusses and minuses and
  must be judged accordingly.
* Patience is a real virtue in chess. If your opponent has little or no counterplay, then why should you feel compelled
  to force the issue? It is much better to take your time and add a host of little advantages to the plusses you already
  possess.

Tips:

* A weak square in front of backward pawn is often a greater problem than the pawn itself
* You can play to win a square by trading off its defenders

Tips:

* The pawn-pointing rule is useful to know in closed or semi-closed positions. If the center is locked, you must attack
  on the wings with pawns. This increases your control of space and opens files for your Rooks. The pawn-pointing rule
  enables you to tell which wing you are supposed to play on by "pointing" the way. See the note to Black's 9th move
  for a more detailed explanation.
* Don't attack something for no reason! Attacking an enemy piece has no value in itself. You must always expect your
  opponent to play the best move, so he will (and you have to believe this!) see the transparent attack and move away
  to
  safety. If you have gained something valuable, even if he sees your threat, then the attack is useful. If there is
  nothing to be gained after his best reply, then restrain yourself and leave his pieces alone! Remember: you are trying
  to follow a plan that benefits your whole army and takes advantage of the weaknesses in his camp. One-move attacks are
  only useful if they do something to benefit your plan.
* Avoid vague thoughts. Concentrate on one or two important features of the position and go as far with them as you can.
  This will enable you to stay on track. If you find yourself saying things like, “I'll somehow attack his King," you
  are
  being too vague. You must only attack the King (or anything else, for that matter) for a specific reason and you must
  be
  very clear with yourself on how you intend to go about doing it.
* Don't allow surprise or depression to influence your moves. If something unexpected or bad happens, you must sit on
  your hands until you regain your equilibrium. When this is done, reassess the situation as if the game were starting
  over again and calmly figure out what the position needs.
* Don't just react to the opponent's threats. At times, defensive moves are called for. However, if you find that you
  have lost track of your own plans and are just reacting to your opponent's blows, you must realize that you are on the
  road to defeat. Chess is a game where the opponent tries to impose his will at on yours. He wants you to do what he
  wants you to do. Fight like a madman and refuse to go with his agenda.

#### Material

* RULE 1 - Material beats the initiative if you can neutralize the opponent's plusses and equalize the game (this might
  take quite a few moves to achieve, so you have to ask if you have the time). Then your extra material will, slowly but
  surely, bring him down.
* RULE 2 — Material gives you an extra unit of force. If you make this unit an active participant in the game, you will
  have your opponent outnumbered.
* RULE 3 - Material edges like the Exchange (Bishop or Knight for a Rook-three points for five) are only useful if you
  can give the Rook an open file to fly on. An advanced, centralized Knight can easily beat an inactive, useless Rook.
  This means that you must be careful not to allow simple point count to influence more than the particular position
* RULE 4 - When you win material you may find your pieces are off balance and without purpose. That is because they have
  fulfilled their mission and now need a new goal. If they are off balance, don't keep lashing out. Instead, bring your
  pieces back together, make everything tight and safe, and then prepare a new plan based on your material edge.
  Remember: extra material gives you a long- term advantage. You don't have to be in a rush to use it.

Tips:

* Once you learn how to break down the imbalances in a position, you have to practice coming up with a plan based on
  these factors.
* Use this same understanding of the imbalances to figure out what the opponent should be doing and then make some
  effort to stop his plans (unless you are sure your plans will come to fruition first).
* Don't ignore your opponent's threats or ideas. Just because you have a superior or even winning position doesn't mean
  there is nothing for your opponent to do!
* You must also avoid getting into a place where all you do is worry about your opponent's intentions. Then you will
  spend the game reacting to his moves and will almost surely lose.
* Avoid the quick, lazy moves that all of us are prone to on occasion. A lazy, ill-considered move often turns out to be
  the losing blunder.
* A material advantage doesn't just win by itself. You have to make use of the extra wood and demonstrate its
  usefulness. A Bishop or a Knight can easily beat a Rook if the Rook doesn't find a useful file. Point-count chess is a
  useful guide but it doesn't mean anything if you don't prove why your numerical superiority gives you an advantage.
* Basic endgame knowledge is very important. Rules like Rooks belong behind passed pawns are knowledge that everyone of
  every class must have!

Tips:

* When playing against an isolated d-pawn, trade off all the minor pieces and the pawn's weaknesses will come to light (
  no attacking chances for the player with the isolated pawn, while the remaining Queen and Rooks will be able to put
  strong pressure against the pawn).
* Even if you win material, you must not forget to read the imbalances and create a plan.

#### Development and Initiative

* RULE 1 - A lead in development usually means that you must start some sort of aggressive act. Quiet play puts no
  pressure on the opponent and will allow him to get the rest of his forces out.

* RULE 2 — A lead in development means the most in open positions because the open central files should enable your army
  to penetrate into the hostile position with relative ease. If you have more pieces out and the position is wide open (
  or even semi-open), then don't hesitate to ATTACK!

* RULE 3 — If the enemy King is still in the center and you have a lead in development, consider these factors an
  invitation to rip the opponent's head off! Start an immediate attack. At the very least, you will keep his King stuck
  in the middle and make him suffer for a long time to come.

* RULE 4 —— A closed position often nullifies a lead in development because the blocked files stop you from effecting
  any real penetration. If you have a big lead in development and think you can blast the
  pawns out of the way, then by all means give it a try. However, more often than not, the side with the deficit in
  development will find that he has ample time to cure this problem if the central situation is locked up.

* RULE 5 —— The goal doesn't have to be mate! If you start an attack and win material (or get the two Bishops in an open
  position, or leave him with weak pawns, etc.) by the time he gets his forces out, then you are in possession of a fine
  static advantage. Don't go crazy and attempt to force an immediate decision where none exists.

Tips

* Figure out if the position is a dynamic one or a static one. If it's dynamic, then you must play with tremendous
  energy.
* Once you decide on a goal (for example: you want to break through in the center) you must take as long as necessary to
  accomplish it (on the clock and on the board). A static goal might take twenty moves. A dynamic goal calls for some
  sort of instant result this means that speed is extremely important. If it takes you forty minutes to figure out how
  to do what you want done, then take forty minutes!
* Never let the opponent dominate you mentally! If you notice that you are meekly reacting to everything he does, you
  must snap yourself out of your trance and fight to establish some sort of psychic control.
* Castle quickly! When your King is safe, you can do
  what you want and play without fear of a mating surprise. If you see a King in the center, do everything you can to
  blast things open and execute it. No subtleties here, just pure brutality!

Tips

* Don't become entranced with your own plans. You must also take note of the opponent's possibilities and gauge just how
  dangerous they really are.
* Part of your plan can be the prevention of the opponent's goals. For example, you can be playing to win a weak pawn
  but can take time out to prevent his Knight from reaching a strong central outpost.
* In an open position, the first person to dominate an open central file will usually gain the initiative.
* The initiative will usually go to the first person who turns his plan into a reality.

Tips

* Always be aware of your opponent's plans and ideas.
  Don't panic in the face of a kingside attack. Size up his real threats, make defensive moves when needed and continue
  with your own plans.
* Follow your plans with gusto. Be devoted to your plan and it will serve you well.
* Don't play with fear in your heart. If
  you play with courage, the worst thing that can happen to you is a loss. Since we will all lose many games in our
  lifetime, we might as well go down with honor and make every game as instructive as possible. Playing passively and
  getting routed is no fun at all and teaches you nothing.
* Worry, confusion and hasty moves leads to gross blunders. If you find your mind fogging up, sit back, relax and take a
  fresh look at the position.
* Chess is a game of willpower. Don't let the
  opponent's will dominate yours. Stick to your plans and don't allow him to distract you from them.
* Take nothing for granted. Don't feel or hope that some line is good or bad. Make sure it is!
* The best defense is a good offense. When you have to defend, try to make a move that also furthers your own plans.
