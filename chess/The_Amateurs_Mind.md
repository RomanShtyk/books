The Amateur's Mind by Jeremy Silman

List of Imbalances:

* Minor Pieces — the interplay between Bishops and Knights (trying to make one superior to the other).
* Pawn Structure — a broad subject that encompasses doubled pawns, isolated pawns, backward pawns, passed pawns, etc.
* Space — the annexation of territory on a chess board.
* Material — owning pieces of greater value than the opponent's.
* Files and squares — files, ranks, and diagonals act as pathways for your pieces, while squares act as homes. Whole
  plans can center around the domination of a file, or the creation of a weak square in the enemy camp.
* Development — a lead in development gives you more force in a specific area of the board. This is a temporary
  imbalance because the opponent will eventually catch up.
* Initiative — dictating the tempo of a game. This is also a temporary imbalance.
