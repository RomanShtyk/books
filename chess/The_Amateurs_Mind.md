The Amateur's Mind by Jeremy Silman

#### List of Imbalances:

* Minor Pieces — the interplay between Bishops and Knights (trying to make one superior to the other).
* Pawn Structure — a broad subject that encompasses doubled pawns, isolated pawns, backward pawns, passed pawns, etc.
* Space — the annexation of territory on a chess board.
* Material — owning pieces of greater value than the opponent's.
* Files and squares — files, ranks, and diagonals act as pathways for your pieces, while squares act as homes. Whole
  plans can center around the domination of a file, or the creation of a weak square in the enemy camp.
* Development — a lead in development gives you more force in a specific area of the board. This is a temporary
  imbalance because the opponent will eventually catch up.
* Initiative — dictating the tempo of a game. This is also a temporary imbalance.

#### Rules of minor pieces:

1) Both 3 points
2) Bishops are best on open space where pawns are not blocking their diagonals
3) Bishops are strong in endgames where both sides have passed pawns. Long range makes them far superior to short-range
   Knights
4) Term "Bad Bishop" means that your bishop is on the same color as your central pawns. Even bad bishop can be a very
   strong piece if it is outside a pawn chain
5) Bishop weakness is that it is stuck on the same color. Pair of bishops working together can negate this
6) Knights love closed positions with locked pawns
7) Knights usually better in the center of the board
8) Knight has to have an outpost to be effective
   8.5) Knight is the best on 6th rank controlling the most crucial squares
9) Knight is superior to bishop in endgame if all pawns are on the one side of the board
10) Best way to counter a knight is to get rid of outposts, hence making outpost is a priority if you have a knight

Tips

* The imbalance of Bishop versus Knight is of vital importance. If you have the Bishop you must strive to take away all
  the advanced posts from the enemy Knight. If you have the Knight you must fight to create a good home for the horse
  and to create situations where the Bishop is not particularly useful.
* Bishop versus Knight does not necessarily favor one piece or the other; you must plant the seeds which allow your
  piece to prosper. The same holds true for all the other imbalances. If you don't recognize and use it, you will find
  that this so-called advantage won't do you any good.
* You must take your opponent's possibilities into account!
* Don't ever play a quick, thoughtless move. That will usually turn out to be the move that ruins your game.

Tips

* If the integrity of your position is based on a one-mover like ...Qxg2 mate, then you are dead meat since such an
  obvious threat is usually easy to parry. Instead, you should nurture long-range plusses like material, superior minor
  pieces, etc.
* When you find yourself crossing your fingers and hoping he won’t see it, you know that you are in desperate trouble!
* Once a minor piece imbalance is established, you must play with great energy to make that imbalance favor you.

Tips

* Always expect the best move
* If you have 2 bishops, try to open up the position
* Rules are useful, but every rule was made to be broken...
* Create a plan right away
* bishops are really better in pawn race endgames

#### The center, territory and space

Rule 1: full pawn center gives control over key squares
Rule 2: full pawn center is responsibility, when you achieve it - make it indestructible
Rule 3: do not advance the center too early, every pawn move leaves a weakness
Rule 4: strive to attack full center
Rule 5: if central pawns are traded than open file exists for rooks
Rule 6: if center is blocked - play switches to the wings
Rule 7: if center is blocked - play on the wing your pawn are pointing
Rule 7.5: push the pawn that stand next to your most advance pawn
Rule 8: A wide open center allows you to attack with pieces. A closed center generally means that you must attack with
pawns (this enables you to grab space and open files for your Rooks)

#### Rules of space:

1) if you have more space - better to avoid exchanges
2) spatial plus is a permanent advantage, no need to hurry to utilize it

Tips:

* Try and appraise your position honestly.
* Never give up hope! A positive fighter’s attitude will bring you points even from the most hopeless-looking situation.
* Look to the center for play. Chess is not just a bunch of battles on the wings.
* Passive, planless play will lead to a loss every time.
* Know what the opponent is planning at all times but don’t allow yourself to become mesmerized by his ideas.
  Ultimately, your plans should prove to be stronger than his.
* Don’t make pointless one-move attacks. If you are crossing your fingers and hoping he doesn’t see it, you are making
  the wrong move (you are also building bad mental habits). Always expect your opponent to see your threats! You want to
  play a move that improves your position no matter what he does. I tend to repeat this a lot, but I find it’s a mistake
  that the amateur makes over and over again.

Tips:

* Even a seemingly bad opening will have some positive points. If you don't take what your opponent is doing
  seriously, then these positive points will end up beating you.
* A plan comes before development.
* When you accept laziness into your mental processes, it becomes a habit that's hard to break. Work hard from the
  very first moves!
* If you think you see a win, but are worried about falling into a trap, you must be courageous and make him prove his
  point. Never let fear talk you out of a course of action.
* If you're going to worry about something, make sure
  it is worth worrying about!
* Games are often won by simply taking space and
  restricting the opponent's options. You don't have to attack like a wild man to score a point.
* Once you start a plan, make sure you finish it. Don't allow yourself to get sidetracked.
* If you own the center and are killing all the opponent's counterplay, there is no hurry to start an attack on the
  wing. Continue to take your time, gain and take away the enemy's options.

Tips:

* You can win games by just increasing your edge in territory bit by bit
* if you have space advantage, try to restrict the enemy pieces
* the side with more space should not trade too many pieces and vice-versa
* Don't be in rush to force things, A slow squeeze is enough to torture the opponent and force his eventual
  capitulation

Tips:

* Space advantage means little if there is no way to penetrate the enemy position
* Open files are precious things, don't close the very road you so desperately need.

Tips:

* Feel free to grab as much space as you can as long as you are not creating weaknesses in your position
* Don't allow a race if you don't have to
* It is a rarely good idea to keep your king in a center

#### Pawn structure

Doubled Pawns:

* NEGATIVE — The doubling of pawns reduces their flexibility and, at times, leaves one or both of them vulnerable to
  attack (though it’s usually the lead pawn that is the weaker).
* POSITIVE — The doubling of pawns leads to extra open files for your Rooks and increased square control.

Isolated Pawns:

* 1st NEGATIVE — An isolated pawn cannot be defended by another pawn and is very vulnerable to attack if it stands on an
  open file.
* 1st POSITIVE — The creation of an isolated pawn may bestow upon its owner the use of a half-open file.
* 2nd NEGATIVE — The formula to beat an isolated pawn calls for control of the weak square in front of the pawn so it
  can’t move, the trade of all minor pieces (which ends all attacking chances for the owner of the isolated pawn), the
  retention of a Queen (this stops the enemy King from taking part in the defense of the pawn) and one or two Rooks (
  which will be used to attack the pawn), the doubling of these pieces against the pawn and the use of a friendly pawn
  to attack the pinned isolated target.
* 2nd POSITIVE — an isolated pawn at d4(white)-d5(black)  gives his owner plenty of space and open files for his rooks.
  The owner should play for dynamic play with his pieces.

Backward pawns:

* NEGATIVE —— A backward pawn is only weak if it is sitting on an open file and if it is unable to advance. The side
  playing against the backward pawn should strive to control the square directly in front of it (turning it into an
  immobile target), since this square cannot be defended by a pawn. One way to do this is to exchange all the pieces
  that defend this square.
* POSITIVE —— A backward pawn acts as a guard to a more advanced pawn to the side of it. This ad- vanced pawn can block
  enemy pieces and control important squares. The backward pawn cannot be considered a bad thing if the square in front
  of it is well-defended.

Hanging pawns:

* NEGATIVE This kind of structure can be weak if the other side is able to circumvent any dynamic advance of the pawn
  duo and, since the pawns would then be immobile, train the power of all his pieces against them.
* POSITIVE The traditional hanging pawns on c5 and d5 (or c4 and d4 if White has them) control many important central
  squares, give their owner an advantage in territory and also offer play on the half-open b-file and e-file.

Passed pawns:

* Negative - A protected passed pawn is not always an advantage, though most players think it is. If the square in front
  of the pawn can be controlled by the other side, then the pawn is stopped in its tracks and becomes a non-factor for a
  long time. Even worse, if this square falls to a Knight, then the horse will radiate power on the neighboring squares
  and pawns.
* Positive - A passed pawn is very strong if its owner has play elsewhere. Then it can be used as endgame insurance. A
  passed pawn is also strong if the square in front of it is cleared for the pawn's advance. As can be seen, when a
  passed pawn exists, the square in front of it becomes the most important square on the board. Whoever owns this square
  dominates the game, so great energy and imagination must be demonstrated by both sides if they want to wrest control
  of this critical point.

Tips:

* A weak pawn is really weak if you can seriously attack it or make use of a weak squares that may come with them
* Always play to improve your position. Don't panic and retreat from good squares.
* Owning hanging pawns means that you must play dynamically. Passive play will lead to your hanging pawns turning into
  weaknesses.
* If you are playing against hanging pawns, you must attack them with everything you've got.

Tips:

* Any kind of weak pawn must first be contained (blocked) before it is attacked.
* No pawn structure is always good or bad. Look for the potential plusses in any given structure and make sure the
  opponent doesn't achieve them.
* Though I repeat this in every chapter, I will take time to do so again: Don't just react to the opponent's plans. Find
  an active idea and follow it with as much energy as you can muster. On the other hand, don't get carried away with
  your own ideas and forget that you have an opponent. Take his plans into account and make adjustments when necessary.

Tips:

* A so-called weak pawn is only weak if it can be attacked! Each individual pawn has its own plusses and minuses and
  must be judged accordingly.
* Patience is a real virtue in chess. If your opponent has little or no counterplay, then why should you feel compelled
  to force the issue? It is much better to take your time and add a host of little advantages to the plusses you already
  possess.

Tips:

* A weak square in front of backward pawn is often a greater problem than the pawn itself
* You can play to win a square by trading off its defenders
