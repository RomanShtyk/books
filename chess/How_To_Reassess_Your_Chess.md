9How to reassess your chess by Jeremy Silman

Chapter 1: Basic Endgame Principles

It is always a good idea ot trap the enemy King as far away as possible from the scene of action.

In general, don't allow the side with the extra pawn to get his King in front of his pawn. (Lucena position)
How to Win Lucena (the technique is called "building a bridge"):
Get your rook to the 4th rank!
(or one rank ahead of where the opponent's rook is checking)

    Example: If Black rook checks from the 4th (like a4), you put your rook on d4 (same rank).

    When you get checked, hide behind your rook.
    The rook acts like a shield so your king stops being checked.

    Once you're shielded, promote the pawn.
    Now the Black rook can't stop you without giving up the rook.

If your King is forced to leave the queening square of the pawn and run to one side or the other, always run ot the
short side of the board.

Chapter 2: IMBALANCES AND THE 'SILMAN THINKING TECHNIQUE'

Here is a breakdown of the different imbalances:

1) Superior Minor Piece (the interplay between Bishops and Knights).
2) Pawn Structure (a broad subject that encompasses doubled pawns, isolated pawns, etc).
3) Space (the annexation of territory on a chess board).
4) Material (owning pieces of greater value than the opponent's).
5) Control of a key file or square (files and diagonals act sa pathways for your pieces, while squares act as homes).
6) Lead in development (more force ni a specific area of the board).
7) Initiative (dictating the tempo of a game).

Chapter 4: MINOR PIECES IN THE MIDDLEGAME

In a way, a Bishop vs. Knight battle is a pretty clear-cut thing. Here are the basics:
Owner of the Bishop:

* Make it as active as possible by placing it on a free diagonal, or creating an uncluttered diagonal if one doesn't
  already exist.
* Prove that it's performing a key function and is thus extremely useful.
* Steer things into an endgame where the long-range capabilities of the Bishop give it a huge edge over the enemy
  Knight.:
* Don't allow the enemy Knight to find its way to an advanced, permanent support point. This calls for Anti-Knight
  Strategy - Do your best to take away all advanced squares from the enemy horse!
  Owner of the Knight:
* Closing the position is often good for your Knight.
* Steer for endgames where all the pawns are on one side of the board. This negates the enemy Bishop's long-range
  abilities while amplifying the importance of the Knight's ability to attack both white and dark squares.
* Do your best to create a permanent advanced home (support point) for your Knight.
* If a tasty support point exists but it seems a long way away (and perhaps impossible to reach), try hard to find a way
  to get there! It might take several moves, but that's what moves are for-to place your pieces on their best squares so
  they can exert maximum effect on the board.
* Avoid "Trapped Knight Syndrome"! Many a Knight has been lost when it found itself trapped by the enemy Bishop.
* Anti-Bishop pair formula: In the case of two Bishops vs. a Bishop and Knight, the simplest way to remove the
  opponent's Bishop pair is to exchange one of the enemy Bishops (either by trading your Knight or Bishop for an enemy
  Bishop), thus creating a
* far more manageable Bishop vs. Knight or Bishop vs. Bishop situation.
* Two Knights don't work particularly well together, so exchanging one of them (for an enemy Bishop or Knight) is
  usually a good idea.
