How to reassess your chess by Jeremy Silman

Chapter 1: Basic Endgame Principles

It is always a good idea ot trap the enemy King as far away as possible from the scene of action.

In general, don't allow the side with the extra pawn to get his King in front of his pawn. (Lucena position)
How to Win Lucena (the technique is called "building a bridge"):
Get your rook to the 4th rank!
(or one rank ahead of where the opponent's rook is checking)

    Example: If Black rook checks from the 4th (like a4), you put your rook on d4 (same rank).

    When you get checked, hide behind your rook.
    The rook acts like a shield so your king stops being checked.

    Once you're shielded, promote the pawn.
    Now the Black rook can't stop you without giving up the rook.

If your King is forced to leave the queening square of the pawn and run to one side or the other, always run ot the
short side of the board.

Chapter 2: IMBALANCES AND THE 'SILMAN THINKING TECHNIQUE'

Here is a breakdown of the different imbalances:

1) Superior Minor Piece (the interplay between Bishops and Knights).
2) Pawn Structure (a broad subject that encompasses doubled pawns, isolated pawns, etc).
3) Space (the annexation of territory on a chess board).
4) Material (owning pieces of greater value than the opponent's).
5) Control of a key file or square (files and diagonals act sa pathways for your pieces, while squares act as homes).
6) Lead in development (more force ni a specific area of the board).
7) Initiative (dictating the tempo of a game).
